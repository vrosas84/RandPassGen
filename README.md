I created this app to start learning python.
This app runs in a terminal window and all input and output is done through that
The original tutorial was extremely simple.
It assumed the user entered the correct info every time and just ran sequentially

I decided to update it to include some basic error checking for both data input
(making sure valid data was entered) and that it was within the range specified.

On top of this, since I learned  programming through Java and have always liked OOP
and modular programs, i decided to modularize the program so methods can be reused.
I also created variables to store all the data instead of hard coding. Hardcoding
data instead of using variables (especially when using that data in multiple places)
is a very big pet-peeve of mine and I think is a poor coding practice. 

I may update it a bit more and modularize the error checking since I do use it in
multiple places. This isn't necessary but would simplify the code a bit more.
